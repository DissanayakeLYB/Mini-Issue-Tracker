# Mini-Issue-Tracker

Mini Issue Tracker is a lightweight, web-based application built to help small engineering teams track bugs and feature requests without the overhead of a full project management system.

The app allows users to create, view, update, and delete issues through a simple, intuitive interface. Each issue includes a title, description, status, priority, and timestamps for creation and updates.

This project is built as a single-page application (SPA) using React on the frontend and a RESTful API with Node.js and Express on the backend. For the initial version, all data is stored in memory, making it ideal for rapid prototyping and local development.

The goal of this project is to practice building a clean, well-structured fullstack application following industry best practices such as proper API design, input validation, meaningful error handling, and separation of concerns.
